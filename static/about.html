                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Frank Hucek. I am a self-taught furniture maker based in Heber City, UT.
                        <br><br>Ever since I was very young, I was always making things. Growing up, I built my own blacksmith forge and did quite a bit of stained glass work. In college for Computer Science, I took 2 years of pottery. In 2021 when my son was born, I started making furniture and have been doing it ever since. I apply my lifelong experiences and passion for making artwork to my furniture.
                        <br><br>I specialize in creating heirloom furniture, my work emphasizes inlay and ornamentation, combining traditional craftsmanship with modern styling. I use only the finest solid hardwoods and no plywood of any kind. I finish all of my work with hand-rubbed finishes. Depending on the function of the piece, I use a variety of finishes, favoring my own blend of shellac, or an oil and varnish. I avoid stains, preferring to let the natural beauty of the wood shine through. It is amazing the variety of colors and patterns that can be found in different species of wood.
                        <br><br>Each piece is built to last generations, showcasing the natural beauty of the wood.
                        <br><br>I have a passion for hand tool work. All dovetails are hand cut. My inlay is all done by hand - I never use a powered router. This ends up giving each piece a personal, human touch that is hard to find in today's world of mass-produced furniture.
                        <br><br>Almost all of my work is my own design, taking inspiration from various furniture styles and designs. I am always looking for new challenges and new designs to build.
                        <br><br>If you are interested in a piece of bespoke furniture crafted to an uncompromising standard of quality, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. I would love to work with you to create a piece that will last for generations. I guarantee all of my work for life, and provide repair support and free refinishing as needed.
